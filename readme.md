I want to challenge myself so I played around with Node.js, and setup a web server on DigitalOcean, and created a little widet that will 
tell you the high and low temps of any city in the world as well as its current weather with an icon based on what the weather currently is.
I used an api from open weather map (api.openweathermap.org) to pass the city and then picked out what i needed from the json it returned.
I then used the https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations to setup my app
